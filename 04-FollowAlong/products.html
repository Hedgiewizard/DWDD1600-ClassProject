        <h2>Electric Skateboards</h2>
        <p>An electric skateboard is a personal transporter based on a <a href="https://www.skatewarehouse.com/decks.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">skateboard</a>. The speed is usually controlled by a wireless hand-held throttle remote or rider body weight-shifting between front of the board for forward motion and rear for braking. The sideways direction of travel is adjusted by tilting the board to one side or the other. Electric skateboards are not considered as vehicles and do not require registration or licensing.</p>
