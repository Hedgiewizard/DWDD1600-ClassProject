                    <h2>Hi I’m his kid! I’m maintaining the site!</h2>
                    <p>I typically go by YaBoiAchilles online. I am currently, most of the way through college, who likes to eat and cook good food.
                        <br> Why am I doing this? What made this website happen? Well, back in like 2018-19, my dad suggested I make him his own cooking website. He was getting really into cooking a bunch of new recipes and posting about them, and I was several years deep into learning to code and design; it made complete sense. Unfortunately, both of us were just busy enough that any time I had time to plan this out, he was busy, and any he had time to plan this out, I was busy. (We both also HEAVILY underestimated how much planning and effort it took to plan your own site, so it was taking a lot longer than either of us planned, but we’re not going to talk about that.) That lead to this plan ending up on the back burner for years.
                        <br> Come back to today: I’m in college, my siblings are starting to move out, and I realize I don’t have too many of the recipes I enjoy from my dad and will probably be moving out in the near future, and it would be nice to have those. This site is an excellent way for me to collect all the recipes my dad has made staples throughout the years and share them with other college-age students moving out and living on their own who still want good homecooked recipes but don’t really know where to start when it comes to looking them up yourself. (We’ve also learned that my dad’s notes app copy of these recipes makes sense to him but is a bit difficult to understand to others, so this gives me an excuse to translate these into a way of writing that is a lot easier for others also to understand but we’re also not going to talk about that.)</p>
